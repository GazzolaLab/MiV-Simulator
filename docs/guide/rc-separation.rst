Separation property of a reservoir culture
==========================================

:::{note}
This example uses the imperative interface.
:::

This example constructs a microcircuit reservoir simulation that
reproduces a classic seperation property experiment by `Maass et
al. 2002 <https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/14/11/2531-2560/6650>`__.

To run this example, make sure to change into the ``3-interface-api``
directory within the `MiV-Simulator-Cases <https://github.com/GazzolaLab/MiV-Simulator-Cases>`__ repository. Then run the
entire ``rc-separation.py`` script or execute each individual step
below.
